From fairest creatures we desire increase
That thereby beautys rose might never die
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And tender churl makst waste in niggarding
Pity the world or else this glutton be
To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use
If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his selflove to stop posterity
Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
But if thou live remembered not to be
Die single and thine image dies with thee
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
Upon thy self thy beautys legacy
Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
And being frank she lends to those are free
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
For having traffic with thy self alone
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
Which used lives th executor to be
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
For neverresting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where
Then were not summers distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Beautys effect with beauty were bereft
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
But flowers distilled though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
Then let not winters ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
Thats for thy self to breed another thee
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
Leaving thee living in posterity
Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair
To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Doth homage to his newappearing sight
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
The eyes fore duteous now converted are
From his low tract and look another way
So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly
Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy
If the true concord of welltuned sounds
By unions married do offend thine ear
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none
Is it for fear to wet a widows eye
That thou consumst thy self in single life
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
When every private widow well may keep
By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
But beautys waste hath in the world an end
And kept unused the user so destroys it
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murdrous shame commits
For shame deny that thou bearst love to any
Who for thy self art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
But that thou none lovst is most evident
For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate
That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee
Against my love shall be as I am now
With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
Hath travelled on to ages steepy night
And all those beauties whereof now hes king
Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
For such a time do I now fortify
Against confounding ages cruel knife
That he shall never cut from memory
My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green
When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced
The richproud cost of outworn buried age
When sometime lofty towers I see downrased
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
And the firm soil win of the watery main
Increasing store with loss and loss with store
When I have seen such interchange of State
Or state it self confounded to decay
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
That Time will come and take my love away
This thought is as a death which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
But sad mortality oersways their power
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
Whose action is no stronger than a flower
O how shall summers honey breath hold out
Against the wrackful siege of battring days
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
O fearful meditation where alack
Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
O none unless this miracle have might
That in black ink my love may still shine bright
Tired with all these for restful death I cry
As to behold desert a beggar born
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
And strength by limping sway disabled
And art made tonguetied by authority
And folly doctorlike controlling skill
And simple truth miscalled simplicity
And captive good attending captain ill
Tired with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone
Ah wherefore with infection should he live
And with his presence grace impiety
That sin by him advantage should achieve
And lace it self with his society
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
And steal dead seeming of his living hue
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow since his rose is true
Why should he live now nature bankrupt is
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
For she hath no exchequer now but his
And proud of many lives upon his gains
O him she stores to show what wealth she had
In days long since before these last so bad
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
Before these bastard signs of fair were born
Or durst inhabit on a living brow
Before the golden tresses of the dead
The right of sepulchres were shorn away
To live a second life on second head
Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay
In him those holy antique hours are seen
Without all ornament it self and true
Making no summer of anothers green
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
And him as for a map doth Nature store
To show false Art what beauty was of yore
Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
They look into the beauty of thy mind
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
The soil is this that thou dost common grow
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
For slanders mark was ever yet the fair
The ornament of beauty is suspect
A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
So thou be good slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
And thou presentst a pure unstained prime
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Either not assailed or victor being charged
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
If some suspect of ill masked not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
Nay if you read this line remember not
The hand that writ it for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
If thinking on me then should make you woe
O if I say you look upon this verse
When I perhaps compounded am with clay
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
But let your love even with my life decay
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone
O lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love
After my death dear love forget me quite
For you in me can nothing worthy prove
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
To do more for me than mine own desert
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart
O lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue
My name be buried where my body is
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
And so should you to love things nothing worth
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
Deaths second self that seals up all in rest
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
As the deathbed whereon it must expire
Consumed with that which it was nourished by
This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
But be contented when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away
My life hath in this line some interest
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
When thou reviewest this thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee
The earth can have but earth which is his due
My spirit is thine the better part of me
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
The prey of worms my body being dead
The coward conquest of a wretchs knife
Too base of thee to be remembered
The worth of that is that which it contains
And that is this and this with thee remains
So are you to my thoughts as food to life
Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
As twixt a miser and his wealth is found
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
Now counting best to be with you alone
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look
Possessing or pursuing no delight
Save what is had or must from you be took
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
Or gluttoning on all or all away
Why is my verse so barren of new pride
So far from variation or quick change
Why with the time do I not glance aside
To newfound methods and to compounds strange
Why write I still all one ever the same
And keep invention in a noted weed
That every word doth almost tell my name
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
O know sweet love I always write of you
And you and love are still my argument
So all my best is dressing old words new
Spending again what is already spent
For as the sun is daily new and old
So is my love still telling what is told
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
Times thievish progress to eternity
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
Those children nursed delivered from thy brain
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
These offices so oft as thou wilt look
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
Have added feathers to the learneds wing
And given grace a double majesty
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
In others works thou dost but mend the style
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
But now my gracious numbers are decayed
And my sick muse doth give an other place
I grant sweet love thy lovely argument
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
O how I faint when I of you do write
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame
But since your worth wide as the ocean is
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
My saucy bark inferior far to his
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay
Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
From hence your memory death cannot take
Although in me each part will be forgotten
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
Though I once gone to all the world must die
The earth can yield me but a common grave
When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
Which eyes not yet created shall oerread
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
When all the breathers of this world are dead
You still shall live such virtue hath my pen
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
I grant thou wert not married to my muse
And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject blessing every book
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days
And do so love yet when they have devised
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
In true plain words by thy truetelling friend
And their gross painting might be better used
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set
I found or thought I found you did exceed
That barren tender of a poets debt
And therefore have I slept in your report
That you your self being extant well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
This silence for my sin you did impute
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
For I impair not beauty being mute
When others would give life and bring a tomb
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise
Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired every where
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
My tonguetied muse in manners holds her still
While comments of your praise richly compiled
Reserve their character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polished form of well refined pen
Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought whose love to you
Though words come hindmost holds his rank before
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
Bound for the prize of all too precious you
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
No neither he nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid my verse astonished
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
As victors of my silence cannot boast
I was not sick of any fear from thence
But when your countenance filled up his line
Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
Thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing
Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgement making
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king but waking no such matter
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
And place my merit in the eye of scorn
Upon thy side against my self Ill fight
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
With mine own weakness being best acquainted
Upon thy part I can set down a story
Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
And I by this will be a gainer too
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
The injuries that to my self I do
Doing thee vantage doublevantage me
Such is my love to thee I so belong
That for thy right my self will bear all wrong
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
And I will comment upon that offence
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
Against thy reasons making no defence
Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
To set a form upon desired change
As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
Lest I too much profane should do it wronk
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
For thee against my self Ill vow debate
For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
And do not drop in for an afterloss
Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purposed overthrow
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come so shall I taste
At first the very worst of fortunes might
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so
Some glory in their birth some in their skill
Some in their wealth some in their bodys force
Some in their garments though newfangled ill
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
But these particulars are not my measure
All these I better in one general best
Thy love is better than high birth to me
Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs
Of more delight than hawks and horses be
And having thee of all mens pride I boast
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
All this away and me most wretchcd make
But do thy worst to steal thy self away
For term of life thou art assured mine
And life no longer than thy love will stay
For it depends upon that love of thine
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
When in the least of them my life hath end
I see a better state to me belongs
Than that which on thy humour doth depend
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
O what a happy title do I find
Happy to have thy love happy to die!
But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not
So shall I live supposing thou art true
Like a deceived husband so loves face
May still seem love to me though altered new
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
In manys looks the false hearts history
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
They that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
They rightly do inherit heavens graces
And husband natures riches from expense
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
The summers flower is to the summer sweet
Though to it self it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
That tongue that tells the story of thy days
Making lascivious comments on thy sport
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
Naming thy name blesses an ill report
O what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee
Where beautys veil doth cover every blot
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!
Take heed dear heart of this large privilege
The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less
Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteemed
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated and for true things deemed
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year!
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen!
What old Decembers bareness everywhere!
And yet this time removed was summers time
The teeming autumn big with rich increase
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Like widowed wombs after their lords decease
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
And thou away the very birds are mute
Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
That leaves look pale dreading the winters near
From you have I been absent in the spring
When proudpied April dressed in all his trim
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Could make me any summers story tell
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
Nor did I wonder at the lilys white
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
Yet seemed it winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play
The forward violet thus did I chide
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
If not from my loves breath The purple pride
Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells
In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed
The lily I condemned for thy hand
And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
One blushing shame another white despair
A third nor red nor white had stoln of both
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath
But for his theft in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death
More flowers I noted yet I none could see
But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee
Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
In gentle numbers time so idly spent
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument
Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey
If time have any wrinkle graven there
If any be a satire to decay
And make times spoils despised everywhere
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
Both truth and beauty on my love depends
So dost thou too and therein dignified
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed
Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
But best is best if never intermixed
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be praised of ages yet to be
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
I love not less though less the show appear
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
The owners tongue doth publish every where
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
As Philomel in summers front doth sing
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth
That having such a scope to show her pride
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside
O blame me not if I no more can write!
Look in your glass and there appears a face
That overgoes my blunt invention quite
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
Were it not sinful then striving to mend
To mar the subject that before was well
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
And more much more than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it
To me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Such seems your beauty still three winters cold
Have from the forests shook three summers pride
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead
Let not my love be called idolatry
Nor my beloved as an idol show
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one of one still such and ever so
Kind is my love today tomorrow kind
Still constant in a wondrous excellence
Therefore my verse to constancy confined
One thing expressing leaves out difference
Fair kind and true is all my argument
Fair kind and true varying to other words
And in this change is my invention spent
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
Fair kind and true have often lived alone
Which three till now never kept seat in one
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have expressed
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they looked but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assured
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme
While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent
Whats in the brain that ink may character
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
Whats new to speak what now to register
That may express my love or thy dear merit
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
I must each day say oer the very same
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name
So that eternal love in loves fresh case
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
But makes antiquity for aye his page
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead
O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify
As easy might I from my self depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that my self bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be stained
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
Alas tis true I have gone here and there
And made my self a motley to the view
Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
Made old offences of affections new
Most true it is that I have looked on truth
Askance and strangely but by all above
These blenches gave my heart another youth
And worse essays proved thee my best of love
Now all is done have what shall have no end
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof to try an older friend
A god in love to whom I am confined
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
And almost thence my nature is subdued
To what it works in like the dyers hand
Pity me then and wish I were renewed
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
No bitterness that I will bitter think
Nor double penance to correct correction
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me
Your love and pity doth th impression fill
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
For what care I who calls me well or ill
So you oergreen my bad my good allow
You are my all the world and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue
None else to me nor I to none alive
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
In so profound abysm I throw all care
Of others voices that my adders sense
To critic and to flatterer stopped are
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind
Seems seeing but effectually is out
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight
The most sweet favour or deformedst creature
The mountain or the sea the day or night
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
Incapable of more replete with you
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
And that your love taught it this alchemy
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
Creating every bad a perfect best
As fast as objects to his beams assemble
O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin
Those lines that I before have writ do lie
Even those that said I could not love you dearer
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
But reckoning time whose millioned accidents
Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
Divert strong minds to the course of altring things
Alas why fearing of times tyranny
Might I not then say Now I love you best
When I was certain oer incertainty
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
Love is a babe then might I not say so
To give full growth to that which still doth grow
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
O no it is an everfixed mark
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
It is the star to every wandring bark
Whose worths unknown although his height be taken
Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
Within his bending sickles compass come
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
Wherein I should your great deserts repay
Forgot upon your dearest love to call
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
That I have frequent been with unknown minds
And given to time your own dearpurchased right
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight
Book both my wilfulness and errors down
And on just proof surmise accumulate
Bring me within the level of your frown
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
The constancy and virtue of your love
Like as to make our appetite more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge
As to prevent our maladies unseen
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
Even so being full of your neercloying sweetness
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
To be diseased ere that there was true needing
Thus policy in love t anticipate
The ills that were not grew to faults assured
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
But thence I learn and find the lesson true
Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
Still losing when I saw my self to win!
What wretched errors hath my heart committed
Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of this madding fever!
O benefit of ill now I find true
That better is by evil still made better
And ruined love when it is built anew
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
So I return rebuked to my content
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent
That you were once unkind befriends me now
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime
O that our night of woe might have remembered
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
And soon to you as you to me then tendered
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits!
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed
When not to be receives reproach of being
And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
Not by our feeling but by others seeing
For why should others false adulterate eyes
Give salutation to my sportive blood
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
Which in their wills count bad what I think good
No I am that I am and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
Unless this general evil they maintain
All men are bad and in their badness reign
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
Full charactered with lasting memory
Which shall above that idle rank remain
Beyond all date even to eternity
Or at the least so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
Of thee thy record never can be missed
That poor retention could not so much hold
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
Therefore to give them from me was I bold
To trust those tables that receive thee more
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me
No! Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel nothing strange
They are but dressings Of a former sight
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told
Thy registers and thee I both defy
Not wondring at the present nor the past
For thy records and what we see doth lie
Made more or less by thy continual haste
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
If my dear love were but the child of state
It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered
As subject to times love or to times hate
Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
No it was builded far from accident
It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
Under the blow of thralled discontent
Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls
It fears not policy that heretic
Which works on leases of shortnumbered hours
But all alone stands hugely politic
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
To this I witness call the fools of time
Which die for goodness who have lived for crime
Weret aught to me I bore the canopy
With my extern the outward honouring
Or laid great bases for eternity
Which proves more short than waste or ruining
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
No let me be obsequious in thy heart
And take thou my oblation poor but free
Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
But mutual render only me for thee
Hence thou suborned informer a true soul
When most impeached stands least in thy control
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour
Who hast by waning grown and therein showst
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst
If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
She may detain but not still keep her treasure!
Her audit though delayed answered must be
And her quietus is to render thee
In the old age black was not counted fair
Or if it were it bore not beautys name
But now is black beautys successive heir
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame
For since each hand hath put on natures power
Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
But is profaned if not lives in disgrace
Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
At such who not born fair no beauty lack
Slandering creation with a false esteem
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
That every tongue says beauty should look so
How oft when thou my music music playst
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame
Is lust in action and till action lust
Is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damasked red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to my self alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
One on anothers neck do witness bear
Thy black is fairest in my judgments place
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Ist not enough to torture me alone
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed
Of him my self and thee I am forsaken
A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed
Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
So now I have confessed that he is thine
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will
My self Ill forfeit so that other mine
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
He learned but suretylike to write for me
Under that bond that him as fist doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
Thou usurer that putst forth all to use
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
And Will to boot and Will in overplus
More than enough am I that vex thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in will add to thy will
One will of mine to make thy large will more
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
Think all but one and me in that one Will
If thy soul check thee that I come so near
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with case we prove
Among a number one is reckoned none
Then in the number let me pass untold
Though in thy stores account I one must be
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
And then thou lovst me for my name is Will
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride
Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferred
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutored youth
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
O loves best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flattered be
O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
My tonguetied patience with too much disdain
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
The manner of my pitywanting pain
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Now this illwresting world is grown so bad
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
